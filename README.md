# Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)

A responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) a.k.a. linear responsibility chart (LRC) describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process.

Responsibility assigment matrix using RACIO mnemonic:

* Responsible
* Accountable
* Consultable
* Informable
* Omittable

See https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix


## RACIO


### Responsible

Each role and/or person who does the work to achieve the task.

Typically there is ongoing constant communication.


### Accountable

One role and/or person who is the ultimate authority in charge of the task, such as approving its completion, correctness, commitments, etc.

Typically there is ongoing communication, especially upon milestones, deliverables, changes, etc.


### Consultable

Any role and/or person whose opinions are sought, such as subject matter experts, support services staff, legal counsel, etc.

Typically there is two-way communication, such as when specific help is needed, and before decisions are made.


### Informable

Any role and/or person who is to be kept up-to-date on progress.

Typically there is one-way communication, such as when the task reaches a milestone.


### Omittable

Any role and/or person who is out of scope, or out of the loop, yet worthwhile to have in the matrix, such as someone who's provided a delegate, or is on leave, etc.

Typically there is no communiation, unless something changes to bring the role/person in scope and in the loop.
